Problem
Problem Statement
Write a program that accepts sets of three numbers, and prints the second-maximum number among the three.

Input
First line contains the number of triples, N.
The next N lines which follow each have three space separated integers.
Output
For each of the N triples, output one new line which contains the second-maximum integer among the three.

Constraints
1 ≤ N ≤ 6
1 ≤ every integer ≤ 10000
The three integers in a single triplet are all distinct. That is, no two of them are equal.
