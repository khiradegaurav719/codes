Problem
Chef appeared for a placement test.

There is a problem worth XX points. Chef finds out that the problem has exactly 1010 test cases. It is known that each test case is worth the same number of points.

Chef passes NN test cases among them. Determine the score Chef will get.

NOTE: See sample explanation for more clarity.

Input Format
First line will contain TT, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains of a single line of input, two integers XX and NN, the total points for the problem and the number of test cases which pass for Chef's solution.
Output Format
For each test case, output the points scored by Chef.

Constraints
1 \leq T \leq 1001≤T≤100
10 \leq X \leq 20010≤X≤200
0 \leq N \leq 100≤N≤10
XX is a multiple of 1010.
