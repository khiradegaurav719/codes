Problem
Chef has a bucket having a capacity of KK liters. It is already filled with XX liters of water.

Find the maximum amount of extra water in liters that Chef can fill in the bucket without overflowing.

Input Format
The first line will contain TT - the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains two space separated integers KK and XX - as mentioned in the problem.
Output Format
For each test case, output in a single line, the amount of extra water in liters that Chef can fill in the bucket without overflowing.

Constraints
1 \leq T \leq 1001≤T≤100
1 \leq X \lt K \leq 10001≤X<K≤1000
