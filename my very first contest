problem
In a contest where NN new users visited the contest,

AA users just saw the problems and didn’t make any submissions and hence won’t get any rating.
BB users who made a submission but could not solve any problem correctly. Thus, after the contest, they will get a rating in the range 800 - 1000800−1000.
Everyone else could correctly solve at least 11 problem. Thus, they will get a rating strictly greater than 10001000 after the contest.
You need to output the number of new users in the contest who, after the contest, will get a rating and also the number of new users who will get a rating strictly greater than 10001000.

Input Format
Each input file contains of a single line, with three integers N, AN,A and BB - the number of new users, the number of users who just saw the problem and didn't make any submission, and the number of users who made a submission but could not solve any problem correctly.
Output Format
Output two integers separated by a space in a single line - the number of new users who will get a rating at the end of the contest and the number of new users who will get a rating higher than 10001000.

Constraints
2 \leq N \leq 10002≤N≤1000
1 \leq A \leq 10001≤A≤1000
1 \leq B \leq 10001≤B≤1000
A + B \leq NA+B≤N
