Problem
Chef decided to redecorate his house, and now needs to decide between two different styles of interior design.

For the first style, tiling the floor will cost X_1rupees and painting the walls will cost Y_1rupees.

For the second style, tiling the floor will cost X_2rupees and painting the walls will cost Y_2rupees.

Chef will choose whichever style has the lower total cost. How much will Chef pay for his interior design?

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer TT, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single line of input, containing 44 space-separated integers X_1, Y_1, X_2, Y_2
as described in the statement.
Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line the amount Chef will pay for interior design.

Constraints
1 \leq T \leq 1001≤T≤100
1 \leq X_1, Y_1, X_2, Y_2 \leq 1001≤
 ≤100
