Problem
In discus throw, a player is given 33 throws and the throw with the longest distance is regarded as their final score.

You are given the distances for all 33 throws of a player. Determine the final score of the player.

Input Format
First line will contain TT, number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
Each test case contains of a single line of input, three integers A, B,A,B, and CC denoting the distances in each throw.
Output Format
For each test case, output the final score of the player.

Constraints
1 \leq T \leq 1001≤T≤100
1 \leq A,B,C \leq 1001≤A,B,C≤100
